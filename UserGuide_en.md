#### Customizing the dashboard

This section provides a few tips and tricks on how to customize the dashboard (e.g. by applying filters or limit the number of structures displayed on a map).

 - ***Pop-ups***: If you hover over a point on the map or the chart, you will see a pop-up appearing displaying further information.
 - ***Customize the maps/charts***: 
	- Remove elemenets
	- To gain a better insight in the spatial distribution of health facilities, you can limit the type of structure displayed. Click on the circle in the legend. This will remove the selected type. To add it again, simply click the circle again.
 - ***Apply filters***: Further explore the data by applying custom filters.
   1. Click the <img src=" images/bt_filter.png" height="20" align="top" alt='filter'></img>  button in the top right corner of the dashboard.
   2. You should now see the filter configuration page. Use the drop-down list to select your filter criteria.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	<img src=" images/icon_info.png" height="20" align="top" alt='info'></img>
	<i> Note: In order to download data, you will require access to the corresponding workspace. Contact your system administrator to change your access rights if needed.</i>
</p>

1. Go to the workspace page of your project(see [Access the Data Edit Interface](#Access the Data Edit Interface) steps 1-4 for detailed instructions).
2. In the rightmost column, click the <img src=" images/icon_download.png" height="20" align="top" alt='New record'></img> button. This will download all records (MoDS) of this workspace.

# 4. HeRAMS Administration

This chapter aims to provide an overview of the admin pages in HeRMAS and provides step-by-step instruction for common tasks conducted by advanced users and local administrators. 
The first part of the chapter is dedicated to the concept and management of [Workspaces](#workspaces) while the second part focuses on [project](#projects) level administration as well as the configuration of project specific [dashboards](#configure-the-project-dashboard).

### Workspaces

HeRAMS uses the concept of workspaces to manage user permissions. Each workspace consists of several health facilities and has a dedicated focal point responsible for updating these records. 
A workspace might for example include all health facilities of a geographical region, health facilities managed by a specific partner or any other logical category. 
Thus, the use of workspaces in combination with different levels of permission (see below) assures granular, role-based access control to a project and workspaces. 
While most users only have access to a single workspace, local administrators might have access to several or all workspace and are responsible to add new users to a workspace, change a user's permission or to create additional workspace.

- <img src=" images/icon_refresh.png" height="20" align="top" alt='refresh'></img> **Data Refresh**: This button allows users to manually refresh the data cache of a workspace.
- <img src=" images/icon_edit.png" height="20" align="top" alt='edit'></img> **Update Workspace** allows to change the title or token of a workspace.
- <img src=" images/icon_share.png" height="20" align="top" alt='share'></img> **Share Workspace**:Access to workspaces is granted by sharing a workspace with users. For more information on how to add users to a workspace see [here](#add-a-user-to-a-workspace).

#### Workspace Permissions

There are two permission levels that a user can be granted to a workspace. Users with the role of **Data Editor** have access to update the response data (option 1) while **Workspace Owners** might be given elevated permission (option 2) allowing them to add additional users to their workspace.1.
