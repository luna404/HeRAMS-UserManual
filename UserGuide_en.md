#### Customizing the dashboard

This section provides a few tips and tricks on how to customize the dashboard (e.g. by applying filters or limit the number of structures displayed on a map).

 - ***Mouseover messages***: If you hover with your mouse over a point on the map or the chart, you will see a small pop-up message appearing displaying further information.
 - ***Adjust the map zoom level and focus area***: You can adjsut the zoom level of the maps using the scroll button on your mouse. In addtion, you can change the focus area of the map. 
 Make sure your mouse is located in the map element. Right click and then drag the map in the desired direction. This will move the map focus area.
 - ***Remove items for charts or maps***: By clicking on the icons in the legends, you can remove items from a chart or map.  To add it again, simply click the circle again.
 - ***Reorder map elements***: If the map is zoomed out, it might happen that several points lay on top of each other. To bring a specific category to the front, uncheck the category in the legend. This will remove the category from the map. If you add the category back (click the now empty circle), the category will be added on top of the other points.

# 4. HeRAMS Administration

This chapter aims to provide an overview of the admin pages in HeRAMS and provides step-by-step instruction for common tasks conducted by advanced users and local administrators. 
The first part of the chapter introduces the the concept and management of [Workspaces](#workspaces) while the second part focuses on [Project](#projects) level administration as well as the configuration of project specific [Dashboards](#configure-the-project-dashboard). 

<p align="center">
	<img src="media/images/icon_info.png" height="20" align="top" alt='info'></img>
	<i> Access to each of the sub-sections of this chapter are depending on the tasks a users is expected to complete. If you require your permissions to be changed, please contact your system administrator.</i>
</p>

### Workspaces

HeRAMS uses the concept of workspaces to manage user permissions. Each workspace consists of several health facilities and has a dedicated focal point responsible for updating these records. 
A workspace might for example include all health facilities of a geographical region, health facilities managed by a specific partner or any other logical category. 
Thus, the use of workspaces in combination with different levels of permission (see below) assures granular, role-based access control to a project and the underlying data. 
While most users only have access to a single workspace, local administrators might have access to several or all workspaces. Moreover, local administrators often perform  user management tasks such as adding new users to a workspace, change a user's permission or to create additional workspaces.

- <img src="media/images/icon_refresh_data.png" height="20" align="top" alt='refresh'></img> **Data Refresh**: This button allows users to manually refresh the data cache of a workspace.
- <img src="media/images/icon_pencil_black.png" height="20" align="top" alt='edit'></img> **Update Workspace**: allows to change the title or token of a workspace.
- <img src="media/images/icon_share.png" height="20" align="top" alt='share'></img> **Share Workspace**: Access to workspaces is granted by sharing a workspace with users. For more information on how to add users to a workspace click [here](#add-a-user-to-a-workspace).
- <img src="media/images/icon_delete_black.png" height="20" align="top" alt='delete'></img> **Delete Workspace** See [Delete Worksapces](#delete-workspaces) for further information
- <img src="media/images/icon_download.png" height="20" align="top" alt='download'></img> **Download Data**: Downloads all data associated with the workspace. See *chapter 2* for more informatio on [data download](#download-data).  
- <img src="media/images/icon_data_update_black.png" height="20" align="top" alt='edit data'></img> **Data Update**: This opens the data edit interface. More infomration on data editing and updating is available in the [previous chapter](#edit-data).  

<p align="center">
	<img src="media/images/icon_info.png" height="20" align="top" alt='info'></img>
	<i> The number of buttons visible to you depends on your access rights and might vary from one workspace to another.</i>
</p>

#### Workspace Permissions

There are two permission levels that a user can be granted to a workspace. Users with the role of **Data Editor** have access to update the response data (option 1) while **Workspace Owners** might be given elevated permission (option 2) allowing them to add additional users to their workspace.1. Manage the underlying response data

1. Manage the underlying response data
2. Full access, includes editing the workspace properties, token and response data
