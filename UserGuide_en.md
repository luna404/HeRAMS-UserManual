### The Workspace Page

HeRAMS uses the concept of workspaces to manage user permissions. Each workspace traditionally contains several health facilities with a dedicated focal point responsible for updating these records. A workspace might constitue for example a geographical region, health facilities managed by a specfic partner or any other logical category. This system  allows to tightly control access to the underlying data. 
While most users only have access to a single worksapce, local administrators might have access to several or all workspace and are responsible to add new users to a workspace, change a user's permission or to create additional workspace. 

#### Workspace Permissions
There are two permission levels that a user can be granted to a workspace. Users with the role of **Data Editor** be granted access to manage the underlying response daa (option 1) while **Workspace Owners** might be given elevated permission (option 2) in order for them to be able to add additional users to their workspace.
1. Manage the underlying response data
2. Full access, includes editing the workspace properties, token and response data

#### Add a User to a Workspace
1. To grant a user access to a specific workspace, open the admin interfacce by clicking the <img src="https://github.com/luna404/HeRAMS-UserManual/blob/master/media/images/icon_settings.png" height="20" align="top" alt='settings'></img> button in the top right corner of the screen.
2. In the rightmost column of the table, you should see several action buttons. Click the <img src="https://github.com/luna404/HeRAMS-UserManual/blob/master/media/images/icon_workspace.png" height="20" align="top" alt='worksapce'></img>  icon. This will open the workspace of the selected project.  
3. You should now see a table with all workspaces. For each worksapce the table provides information on the last time data was synced with the underlying database, the number of contributors, health facilities and responses. Alike the project table, the las column contains several action button.
